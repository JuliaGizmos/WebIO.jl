# WebIO Not Detected

You may see this message in your frontend if WebIO is unable to find the active
WebIO instance in the browser.

## Troubleshooting Jupyter
WebIO requires the installation of a Jupyter extension to function properly.

If you're using Jupyter Notebook (classic), run the following.
```julia
using WebIO
WebIO.install_jupyter_nbextension()
```

If you're using Jupyter Lab, run the following.
```julia
using WebIO
WebIO.install_jupyter_nbextension()

# Or, if you are launching via IJulia.jupyterlab()
using WebIO
WebIO.install_jupyter_labextension(condajl=true)
```

Jupyter Lab poses some additional issues that the classic notebook does not.
For more information on those difficulties, read the [IJulia](@ref)
documentation.

### Jupyter Notebook
List all extensions by running
```sh
jupyter nbextension list
```
and uninstalling anything that includes `webio` (in particular, `webio/main`
refers to a previous version of the WebIO extension).

For example,
```sh
jupyter nbextension uninstall --user webio/main
jupyter nbextension uninstall --user webio-jupyter-notebook
```
(note that this may print an error if you don't actually have those extensions
installed and that's okay).

Re-install the Jupyter notebook extension by running (at the Julia REPL)
```julia
using WebIO
WebIO.install_jupyter_nbextension()
```

### Jupyter Lab
Re-install the Jupyter labextension by running (at the Julia REPL)
```julia
using WebIO
WebIO.install_jupyter_labextension()
```

If you launch Jupyter by running `IJulia.jupyterlab()`, run the following
instead.
```julia
using WebIO
WebIO.install_jupyter_labextension(condajl=true)
```
